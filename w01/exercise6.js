/**


A. answering telephone calls in the order of their known priorities'

The data structure that I would use in this situation is the priority queue.
Another potential data structure that I would use in this situation could be
the heap data structure.

B. sending back log orders to customers in the order they have been received
The best data structure in this situation is the queue because it is a
FIFO (first in, first out) data structure. 

C. implementing a calculator for computing simple arithmetical expressions
The priority queue is best for this, if and only if you place a priority on 
the operators according to PEMDAS. This way, you can ensure that the higher
influential operators gets implemented first before the other operations
